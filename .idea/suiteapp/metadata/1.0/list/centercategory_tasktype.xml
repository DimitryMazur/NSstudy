<!--
	Different types of prefixes that are supported for the following custom objects that generate task links on creation:
	Custom Record Type
	Script
	Suitelet Script Deployment

	There are additional custom objects that generate links, but whose prefixes are not explicitly called out here:

	Some only have one type of task, so it is implicit in the reference to the object:
	Custom Center Tab (CARD_)

	Some are not yet exposed in SDF:
	Report - runner (REPO_), composer (REPO_CUST_)
	Custom Center Link (EXTL_)
	Saved Searches - query page (SRCH_FORM_) , result page (SRCH_RSLT_)
	Transaction type - EDIT_TRAN_CUSTOM_, LIST_TRAN_CUSTOM_ (could possibly reuse existing exposed prefixes list, edit
